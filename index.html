Burmese is my first language and I have been learning English my entire life since I attended international schools. I found my interest in IT ever since I was little. For instance, I used to dissect the electronic my parents bought. Later, I install beta versions of the software on my primary devices knowing the risks and tried to find out why and how the bugs occur.
